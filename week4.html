        <h2>EXERCISE NOTES</h2>
        <p>THIS IS MY LOGO DESIGN FROM WEEK 4. INSTEAD OF RECREATING AN EXISITING LOGO I DECIDED TO CREATE MY OWN.
            MY LOGO CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE ELLIPSES, FILLED WITH DIFFERENT SHADES. THERES A SMALL TEXT THAT INCLUDES MY "BRAND NAME".
            I'VE INCLUDED AN IMAGE (NOT CREATED MY ME). </p>
