        <p>This is my Logo design from week 4. I decided to create my own logo, using basic coding to craete my base logo with ellipses and text. The image 
       located in the middle of my logo was not created by me. Heres the reference - file:///Users/gracescott-graham/Downloads/model.jpeg </p>
