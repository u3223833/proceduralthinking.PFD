        <h1>Assignment Aim</h1>
        <p>For this assignment, we had to submit a small web site that provides a demo of 
            the skills we have developed. We focused on learning the basic principles of 
            Javascript programming using the Processing API. From here we had to create three designs; 
            a simple logo, a simple animation, and an interactive artwork using code.</p>
